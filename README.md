# homebrew-misc

This is a [homebrew](https://brew.sh/) [tap](https://docs.brew.sh/Taps) with casks for programs that I use that [might not make it into homebrew-cask](https://docs.brew.sh/Acceptable-Casks).

## How do I install these formulae?

After you [install Homebrew](https://docs.brew.sh/Installation), run the following command to [install a formula](https://docs.brew.sh/Acceptable-Casks):

`brew install thatrobotdev/misc/formula`

Or `brew tap thatrobotdev/misc` and then `brew install formula` (`brew install thatrobotdev/misc/formula` to avoid naming conflicts)

## Documentation

`brew help`, `man brew` or check [Homebrew's documentation](https://docs.brew.sh).
